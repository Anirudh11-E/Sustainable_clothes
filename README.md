.Many wearable clothes are discarded instead of being reused, resold, or upcycled.

.Individuals who want to resell or swap clothing lack a simple and secure platform.

.Trust issues between buyers and sellers reduce participation in peer-to-peer clothing resale.

.There is limited social interaction and community engagement in current fashion marketplaces.
